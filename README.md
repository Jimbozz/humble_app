This is my submission for Project Exam 2.
Humble is a social platform where like-minded users can share thoughts and discuss their favourite topics. You can react and comment on any post, as well as edit and delete any post you have created. A user may also follow and un-follow any other profile on the platform.

The project was built using the [Noroff API](https://noroff-api-docs.netlify.app/).
